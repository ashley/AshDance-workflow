## Step 1

* I learned how to keep track of the original project's changes through the `upstream` flag. I have also never used the `checkout` flag before.
* I learned that there are many different ways that someone can do the wrong thing in the contribution flow. There're a lot of moving parts, and even using the wront `git` command can result in making the wrong branch or making a pull request to the wong branch.
